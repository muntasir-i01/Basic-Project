                </h1>

                <p class="para-one">Moments like these are crucially important because if you become discouraged,
                    chances are you’ll
                    start to
                    procrastinate.
                    The trick is to stay motivated, even when you feel like you’re standing still. Take this skill into
                    2022
                    and you’ll
                    reenergise your whole career approach. Self-trust means consistently staying true to yourself. At
                    its very core, trusting yourself means you look after your
                    own needs and safety. You treat yourself with love and compassion, rather than strive for
                    perfection. You know, deep
                    down, that you can survive difficulties (and you refuse to give up on yourself).</p>

                    Teamwork is recognized as an important skill for engineering and computer science professionals.
                    Both potential
                    employers and accrediting agencies, such as ABET, expect students to gain proficiency in teamwork
                    skills through
                    experiential learning. Teamwork based projects challenge the student to apply the technical
                    knowledge they gain in
                    school to solve meaningful and complex problems. However, to be truly proficient in teamwork, a
                    student must also learn
                    and practice a large number of peripheral skills. These include planning, estimating, tracking
                    progress, taking
                    corrective actions, managing change, controlling and managing risks, maintaining ethical and
                    professional conduct,
                    communicating complex ideas clearly and concisely, using design automation tools, leveraging
                    web-based tools for team
                    collaboration, and most importantly participating effectively as team members.
